# coldd Customer Service Guide

> [!IMPORTANT]
> coldd’s support exists **entirely on Discord**. Customers are often inexperienced with Roblox Studio yet know what they want. Staff are here to **guide, clarify, and assist**, not to provide every perfect answer or re-build products for them.

> [!TIP]
> Acknowledge that you may not know everything - it’s okay to escalate the ticket to a superior, ask a colleague, or point users to our official resources/channels.

> [!WARNING]
> Never give false solutions. Misinformation can ruin coldd's reputation and the client's experience. If you don't know, say so.

## 📘 Purpose

Coldd’s Discord support exists to:

* Help customers use our systems effectively.
* Troubleshoot setup and configuration issues.
* Assist with outreach and giveaway claims.
* Maintain a professional and reliable brand image.

> [!NOTE]

## 🗣️ Communication Standards (SPaG)

Clear communication maintains our brand image. Here's some do's and don't's:

### Always keep

* Proper spelling, punctuation, and capitalization
* Respectful, concise explanations
* Step-by-step guidance when needed

### Avoid

* Slang, sarcasm, or one-word replies
* Assuming customers are experienced
* Writing walls of text without structure

**Example**

❌ Bad:

> bruh idk just redo it

✅ Good:

> Try reinstalling the system and make sure all dependencies are imported. Let me know if the error persists, and I can guide you further.

## 🧠 Best Practices

* **Be clear**: Explain solutions like a guide, not a fix-all.
* **Be honest**: Admit if you don’t know — suggest resources.
* **Be structured**: Use steps, bullet points, or numbered lists.
* **Be professional**: Friendly tone wins over shortcuts or jokes.
